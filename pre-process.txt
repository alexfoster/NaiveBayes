pre-process dataset, eliminate unneeded attributes
I tried to use the weka, but it can't open one... we can actually just choose what we need from the data I think..but they are like hundreds...so let me put the candidates and we can trim from there..
I also put the data dictionary that explains what are each attributes are.
This data are from all the education institutions I think we can only do University that will help to data mine..Also there are many redundant attributes..
1. Institution name (column D in exel) or unit ID for institution
2. Region, City or zip code
3. predominant degree awarded ( not sure this one is helpful)
4. Average cost of attendance ( academic year, program year institution)
5.In-state tuition 
6. Out of state tuition
7. Percentage of undergraduate who receive Pell Grant - aid
8. Percentage of all federal undergraduate students receiving a federal student loan
9. Average faculty salary 
10.Tuition and fees for program year institutions
11.Net tuition revenue per full time equivalent student
